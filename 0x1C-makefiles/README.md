# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## What is Make and Makefiles?
Make is a build automation tool that manages the compilation and execution of programs or projects. It automates the process of building software by determining which pieces need to be recompiled and issuing the necessary commands to compile them. Makefiles are configuration files used by Make to specify dependencies and instructions for building software.

## When, Why, and How to Use Makefiles
Makefiles are used whenever you have a project with multiple source files that need to be compiled into executable programs or libraries. They help automate the build process by defining dependencies between files and specifying the commands needed to build them. Makefiles are particularly useful for large projects with complex build requirements, as they allow for efficient management of compilation tasks.

To use Makefiles, simply create a file named `Makefile` (or `makefile`) in the root directory of your project and define your build rules and dependencies according to the syntax specified by Make.

## Rules and How to Set and Use Them
Rules in Makefiles specify how to build target files from source files. Each rule consists of a target, dependencies, and a command to execute. For example:

```make
target: dependencies
    command
```

To set and use rules, simply define them in your Makefile according to the syntax shown above. The target is the file you want to build, the dependencies are the files required to build the target, and the command is the action needed to build the target.

## Explicit and Implicit Rules
Explicit rules are rules explicitly defined in the Makefile, specifying how to build a target from its dependencies. Implicit rules are predefined rules provided by Make, which specify how to build certain types of files based on their extensions. For example, Make has implicit rules for compiling C source files into object files.

## Most Common/Useful Rules
Some of the most common and useful rules in Makefiles include:
- `all`: Builds all targets in the Makefile.
- `clean`: Removes all generated files.
- `install`: Installs the built software.
- `uninstall`: Uninstalls the installed software.
- `test`: Executes test suites.

## Variables and How to Set and Use Them
Variables in Makefiles are used to store values that can be referenced throughout the file. They are defined using the syntax `variable = value`. Variables are useful for storing compiler flags, file paths, and other configuration settings.

To set and use variables, simply define them in your Makefile and reference them using the syntax `$(variable)`. For example:

```make
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2

target: dependencies
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o target dependencies
```

In this example, `CC` is a variable representing the compiler to use, and `CFLAGS` represents the compiler flags to use during compilation.

With this README, you should have a basic understanding of Make, Makefiles, rules, variables, and how to use them to automate the build process for your projects.
